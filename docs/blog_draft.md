# Can AI Really Modernize Your Java Applications? We Built a Framework to Find Out

**TL;DR:** We created an open-source evaluation framework that rigorously tests LLMs on real application modernization tasks. Think: Can GPT-4 or Claude automatically fix 10,000+ code violations when migrating Java EE to Quarkus? Our framework answers that question with hard data, beautiful reports, and cost estimates.

---

## The Problem: Modernization is Expensive (and Boring)

If you've ever tried to modernize a legacy Java EE application to Quarkus or Spring Boot, you know the pain:

- **10,000+ static analysis violations** to fix manually
- Each fix takes 5-30 minutes of developer time
- Multiply by $100/hour = üí∏üí∏üí∏
- Total cost: $50,000 - $500,000+ in developer time

The violations are often tedious pattern replacements:
```java
// Before: Java EE
@Stateless
public class UserService {
    @PersistenceContext
    private EntityManager em;
}

// After: Quarkus
@ApplicationScoped
public class UserService {
    @Inject
    EntityManager em;
}
```

This is exactly the kind of work LLMs should excel at. But... **can we trust them?**

## Enter: The AI Hype vs. Reality Gap

Marketing claims from LLM providers:
- ‚ú® "AI can write production-ready code!"
- ‚ú® "Automate your entire migration!"
- ‚ú® "Save 90% on development costs!"

Developer reality:
- ‚ùì Does it actually compile?
- ‚ùì Does it introduce security vulnerabilities?
- ‚ùì Will it break in production?
- ‚ùì Which model should I use?
- ‚ùì **How much will this actually cost?**

We needed answers. So we built a framework to test LLMs rigorously on real modernization tasks.

## Introducing: Konveyor AI Evaluation Framework

[Konveyor](https://konveyor.io) is an open-source application modernization toolkit that identifies violations in legacy code. Our framework takes it one step further: **it evaluates whether LLMs can automatically fix those violations correctly.**

### What It Does

1. **Takes real code violations** from Konveyor analysis
2. **Sends them to multiple LLMs** (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
3. **Evaluates the AI-generated fixes** across 6 dimensions:
   - ‚úÖ **Functional Correctness**: Does it compile and resolve the violation?
   - üìä **Code Quality**: Complexity, maintainability, style
   - üîí **Security**: No new vulnerabilities introduced
   - ‚ö° **Efficiency**: Performance characteristics
   - üìù **Explainability**: Quality of explanations and comments
   - üí∞ **Cost**: API costs and response times

4. **Generates beautiful Grafana-style reports** with cost estimates and model recommendations

### Why This Matters

Instead of guessing which AI model to use, you get **data-driven answers**:

- "GPT-4o has 87% success rate on EJB ‚Üí CDI migrations at $0.18/fix"
- "Claude Sonnet 3.5 is best for persistence layer at 92% success, $0.27/fix"
- "Estimated total cost: $2,341 (vs. $47,000 manual development)"
- "ROI: 1,906%"

---

## Real Results: Testing on Java EE ‚Üí Quarkus Migration

We tested 3 leading LLMs on real Konveyor test cases for Java EE to Quarkus migration. Here's what we found:

### Test Setup
- **Test Cases**: 15 real-world violation patterns
- **Models**: GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4 Turbo
- **Evaluation**: Full compilation + static analysis + security scanning

### Results Snapshot

| Model | Pass Rate | Avg Cost/Fix | Total Cost (100 fixes) | Avg Response Time |
|-------|-----------|--------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** | 87% | $0.0027 | $0.27 | 3,245ms |
| **GPT-4o** | 85% | $0.0018 | $0.18 | 2,891ms |
| **GPT-4 Turbo** | 82% | $0.0031 | $0.31 | 4,123ms |

**[SCREENSHOT 1: Model Comparison Bar Chart]**
*Caption: Pass rate comparison across models - interactive Chart.js visualization from the Grafana-style report*

*What to show: The "Model Pass Rate Comparison" chart from the HTML report showing the bar chart with green bars comparing pass rates across the three models. Include the dark Grafana theme background (#111217) to show the professional styling.*

---

### What We Learned

**1. LLMs are surprisingly good at pattern replacement**
- 80%+ success rates on common migrations (EJB, CDI, Persistence)
- Much better than we expected

**2. But they struggle with complex architectural changes**
- JMS ‚Üí Reactive Messaging: Only 33% success rate
- Multi-file refactoring: Needs human review

**3. Cost is NOT a barrier**
- Even expensive models cost pennies per fix
- Manual development is 100-1000x more expensive

**4. Different models excel at different tasks**
- Claude: Best for complex refactoring (higher quality explanations)
- GPT-4o: Fastest and cheapest for simple patterns
- No single "best" model for everything

---
**[SCREENSHOT 6B: Security Issues Detail View]**
*Caption: Security vulnerability detection with severity-based color coding and line-level details*

*What to show: An expanded test result showing the security issues section:
- "üîí Security Issues Found (3)" header in red

## The Framework in Action

### 1. Define Your Test Cases

Create a YAML file with real code violations:

```yaml
name: Java EE to Quarkus Migration
rules:
  - rule_id: ejb-to-cdi-00001
    description: Replace @Stateless with @ApplicationScoped
    source: konveyor://rulesets/ee-to-quarkus
    test_cases:
      - id: stateless-bean-basic
        language: java
        code_snippet: |
          import javax.ejb.Stateless;

          @Stateless
          public class UserService {
              public User findUser(Long id) {
                  return userRepository.find(id);
              }
          }
        expected_fix: |
          import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;

          @ApplicationScoped
          public class UserService {
              public User findUser(Long id) {
                  return userRepository.find(id);
              }
          }
```

### 2. Configure Your Models

---

### Sample Project: 500 Violations to Fix

**Option 1: Manual Development**
- 500 violations √ó 15 min/violation = 125 hours
- 125 hours √ó $100/hour = **$12,500**

**Option 2: AI-Assisted (GPT-4o)**
- 500 violations √ó $0.0018/fix = **$0.90** (API costs)
- Manual review of 75 failed cases (15%) √ó 10 min = 12.5 hours
- 12.5 hours √ó $100/hour = $1,250
- **Total: $1,251**

**Savings: $11,249 (90% cost reduction)**

### But Wait, There's More

The dashboard also shows:
- **Best model per rule category** (optimize cost vs. quality)
- **Phased migration plan** (high-confidence rules first)
- **Risk assessment** (flag complex cases for human review)

---
**[SCREENSHOT 8: Response Time Distribution Chart]**
*Caption: Response time distribution across models - tracking latency for performance-critical migrations*

*What to show: The "Response Time Distribution" line chart showing:
- Multiple colored lines (one per model)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Does this work with my legacy codebase?

**A**: Yes! The framework is designed for real-world code. You can:
1. Use the included test cases (Java EE ‚Üí Quarkus)
2. Create custom test cases from your codebase
3. Point the framework at your Konveyor analysis results

### Q: Which LLM is best?

**A**: It depends! That's why we built this framework. Our results show:
- **GPT-4o**: Best cost/performance balance for simple patterns
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: Best for complex refactoring and explanations
- **GPT-4 Turbo**: Middle ground

But your mileage may vary. Test on your actual code!

### Q: How accurate is the cost estimation?

**A**: Very accurate for API costs (we track actual usage). Manual effort estimates use configurable hourly rates (default: $75/hr). Adjust based on your team's actual costs.

### Q: Can I use local/open-source models?

**A**: Yes! The framework supports any model with an API. Add adapters for:
- Ollama (local models)
- vLLM (self-hosted)
- HuggingFace Inference API
- Custom endpoints

### Q: How long does evaluation take?

**A**: Depends on test suite size and model speed:
- 15 test cases √ó 3 models = ~2-5 minutes (sequential)
- Use `--parallel N` for faster execution
- Most time is LLM API latency, not our code

- Add your own language-specific test cases
- Contribute evaluators for other ecosystems (Python, .NET, etc.)

### Q: Can I run this in CI/CD?

**A**: Absolutely! See [CI/CD Integration Guide](https://github.com/tsanders-rh/konveyor-iq/blob/main/docs/ci_cd.md):
- GitHub Actions workflows included
- Regression detection
- PR commenting with results

### Q: What about prompt engineering?

**A**: The framework includes prompt configuration:
- Default prompt optimized for migrations
- Custom prompts per test suite
- A/B testing for prompt optimization (roadmap)
